* OOP: Object Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a software (or program) using classes and objects. So, it's basically a software design methodology.

* In object-oriented programming, a class is a template definition or blue print from which an objects properties and behaviour is decided. Example: Vehicle or Student Class

* A Object is an instance of class and are real world entities which have their own properties and behaviour. Example: Car, Scooty, Bikes for a vehicle class. 
Thus, an object is a specific instance of a class, it contains real values instead of variables. 

* Abstraction: Showing only essentials part and hiding implementation details. 
The methodology of hiding implementation details from the user and only providing functionality to them. Example: Android APK

WAYS TO ACHIEVE JAVA ABSTRACTION
1) Abstract Class 2) Interface

* Encapsulation: Binding variables and methods under single entity or single class. It leads to data hiding.
OOPS MAKE OUR CODE EASIER TO MAINTAIN, EASIER TO UNDERSTAND, EASIER TO DEVELOP, MORE READIBLE

Class: Student
Variables (or Properties): name, roll no, DOB
Methods: read(), write(), play()
Objects: any student like abc, xyz etc

Class: Dog
Variables (or Properties): breed, size, color, age
Methods (or Behaviour): eat(), sleep(), run(), bark()
Objects: All types of breed like bull dog, German Shephard etc


* Inheritance: Acquiring the properties of one class (parent) to another class (child)
PARENT CLASS -----> CHILD CLASS
BASE CLASS -----> DERIVED CLASS
SUPER CLASS -----> SUB CLASS

Types of Inheritance in JAVA:
1) Single Level Inheritance
2) Multi Level Inheritance
3) Hierarchical Inheritance

Note: Multiple Inheritance not implemented in Java. It is implemented in Java using interfaces.

* Real world example of inheritance: 
 

* Polymorphism (ability to take more than one form): Objects performing different task using same method name. Example: Add() and Add(int a, int b).

It can be broken up into two pieces as described below.
Poly=many
Morphism=Forms/shapes
Polymorphism is one of the important fundamental features of object oriented paradigm. Literally, polymorphism means one name and many forms. In computer science we refer polymorphism as a capability of a method to have multiple definitions.

A SINGLE METHOD IS CAPABLE OF DOING DIFFERENT DIFFERENT ACTION

Types of Polymorphism:
1) Method Overloading (compile time or static polymorphism) - add()
2) Method Overriding (run time or dynamic polymorphism) - marry girl and driving example for parent and child

MORE EXAMPLES
overriding: 
1) suppose there is a method getInterestRate() which returns the interest rate of a bank. RBI is the superclass and it returns 7 for getInterestRate(). 
There are various banks like sbi, axis, icici, etc which extend RBI class and override the getInterestRate() method to return 7.5, 8, 8.5, etc respectively.

abstract class Bank{    
	abstract int getRateOfInterest();    
}    
class SBI extends Bank{    
	int getRateOfInterest(){return 7;}    
}    
class PNB extends Bank{    
	int getRateOfInterest(){return 8;}    
} 

2) 
class Father
{
	void drive()
	{
		//drive cautiously :-)
	}
	void home(){sout("father's home")}
	void mobile(){sout("father's mobile")}
}
class You extends Father
{
	void drive()
	{
		//drive rash! :P
	}
	//after crossing age 18
	void mobile(){sout("my mobile")}
}

3) 
abstract class Shape{  
	abstract void draw();  
}  
//In real scenario, implementation is provided by others i.e. unknown by end user  
class Rectangle extends Shape{  
	void draw(){System.out.println("drawing rectangle");}  
}  
class Circle1 extends Shape{  
	void draw(){System.out.println("drawing circle");}  
}

overloading: 
1) The payment option on any ecommerce website has several options like netbanking, COD, credit card, etc. That means, a payment method is overloaded several times to perform single payment function in various ways.
2) An adjustable screwdriver may work on different types of screws based on the attachment (bit) supplied.
3)  class You
	{
		void talk(Stranger obj)
		{
			sysout("Hi, my day was great!");
		}
		void talk(Beloved obj)
		{
			sysout("Hi, my day was great! You won't believe what happened today! Blah!Blah!Blah!Blah!Blah!Blah!Blah!Blah!Blah!Blah! ");
		}
	}

* If we have to perform only one operation, having same name of the methods increases the readability of the program.
ADVANTAGE of method overloading
Method overloading increases the readability of the program.

* In Java, an abstract class can implement an interface, and not provide implementations of all of the interface's methods
